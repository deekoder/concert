### Prerequisite

* A valid domain name purchased from any domain registrar.
* `root` access to the server pointed by the domain name.
* Working email address for the domain.

```sh
sudo concert gen --dir my-certs admin@example.com example.com
sudo ls my-certs
certs.json public.crt private.key
```

NOTE: Generated certificates are valid only for a maximum of 90 days. Please visit the following link for more details - [https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html)

## How to generate a certificate bundle for various sub domains?

To generate certificates for `example.com` and its sub domains ‘www’, ‘ftp’ and ‘mail’, use `sub-domains` command line option. You need to run this command as `root` on the `example.com` server.

```sh
sudo concert gen --sub-domains www,ftp,mail admin@example.com example.com
```

```bash
sudo ls certs
certs.json public.crt private.key
```

## How to renew a certificate?

```sh
sudo concert renew admin@example.com
```

### How to automatically renew certificates?

```

## How to automatically renew certificates for various sub domains?

To automatically renew cerificates for `example.com` and its sub domains ‘www’, ‘ftp’ and ‘mail’, use `sub-domains` command line option.

```sh
sudo concert server --sub-domains www,ftp,mail admin@example.com example.com
```

### FAQ

* Why `concert` requires root access?

ACME protocol requires root access to verify authenticity of the domain ownership. During the certification generation phase, `concert` temporarily listens on port `80` or `443` to allow letsencrypt.org service connect and verify the ownership. Only `root` is allowed to bind to any port below `1024`.

* Can I run `concert` as non-root?

On GNU/Linux, it is possible to run as non-root by granting bind only access to  `concert`.

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `which concert`
```
